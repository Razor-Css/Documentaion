## Introduction

Get started with Razor CSS, the best framework for building responsive sites, including a template starter page.

## Main CSS & JS

# CSS
Copy-paste the stylesheet `<link>` into your `<head>` before all other stylesheets to load our CSS. <br>
```<link href="https://cdn.razorcss.xyz/css/razor-css-1.1.min.css" rel="stylesheet">```

<br>

# JS
Many of our components require the use of JavaScript to function. Specifically, they require our own JavaScript plugins and Popper. Place one of the following `<script>`s near the end of your pages, right before the closing `</body>` tag, to enable them.
<br> 
```<script src="https://cdn.razorcss.xyz/js/bundle.min.js"></script>```
